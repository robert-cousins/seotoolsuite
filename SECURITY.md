# Security Policy

This document outlines the process for reporting security vulnerabilities and our approach to handling security issues responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities. If you discover a potential security flaw, please report it privately to help protect the community. Use one of the following ways to report security issues:
- **GitHub Security Advisories:** Use the [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/nitishkgupta/seotoolsuite/security/advisories/new) under "Security".
- **Email:** nitishkgupta1@gmail.com

## Security Response Process

We take security issues seriously and aim to address them as quickly as possible. Upon receiving a report, the maintainers will:

- Acknowledge receipt within **48 hours**.
- Verify the vulnerability and determine its severity.
- Work on a fix.
- Notify the reporter once the fix is ready for testing or has been deployed.
- Publicly disclose the vulnerability in our release notes (giving you credit).
